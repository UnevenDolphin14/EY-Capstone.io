                <p><strong>Died:</strong> April 14, 2021, Federal Medical Center, Butner, North Carolina, U.S.</p>
                <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Stockbroker, investment advisor, financier</p>
                <p><strong>Criminal Charge:</strong> Securities fraud, investment adviser fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, three counts of money laundering, false statements, perjury, false filings with the SEC, theft from an employee benefit plan</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Bernie Madoff founded the Wall Street firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC in 1960 and was its chairman until his arrest on December 11, 2008. The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street, which bypassed "specialist" firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers.</p>
                <h2>Ponzi Scheme</h2>
                <p>In 2008, Madoff was arrested and charged with securities fraud. The Ponzi scheme, which is considered the largest financial fraud in U.S. history, involved a reported $64.8 billion.</p>
                <p>Madoff's scheme was revealed when he was unable to keep up with the increasing demands for redemptions by his clients. On December 10, 2008, he confessed to his sons that the asset management unit of his firm was a massive Ponzi scheme.</p>
                <h2>Conviction and Imprisonment</h2>
                <p>On March 12, 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies and admitted to turning his wealth management business into a massive Ponzi scheme. On June 29, 2009, he was sentenced to 150 years in prison with restitution of $170.8 billion.</p>
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>Madoff's fraud had a devastating impact on his investors, many of whom lost their life savings. The scandal also led to increased regulatory scrutiny and changes in the financial industry to prevent similar frauds in the future.</p>
